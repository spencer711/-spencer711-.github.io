			<p>Raptors are considered to be one of the most predatorial bird still in existence. They are a group of terrestrial birds of flight that live mainly in the Southern Hemisphere, because it seems as if all major lineages within Accipitridae had an origin to one of the biogeographic realms of the southern hemisphere. There are many types of different raptors, but the most interesting type in my opinion would have to be hawks. There are over 200 species of meat eating birds which we refer to as hawks. Hawks also have some of the best hearing and vision on the planet. They can hear and see up to 8x as far/much as we can. Hawks typically breed in early spring and for the majority of the time will find a mate and pair up for life. </p>

		 <p>Hawks are a rare bird, with many of them being at risk from human activity. 17 Hawk species are endangered, 32 are vulnerable, and 5 are near threatened. Hawks are in danger because of various reasons such as: hunting them for oil, taking their eggs, destroying their natural environment, and various other reasons. We need to do all that we cans for these little guys so that they can get off the endangered and vulnerable species lists, and grow in population size once again. However, with that being said, Hawks are one of the most exotic bird species due to their hunting tactics. </p>
		 <p>There are over 200 known hawk species in the world, and everyone has their own favorites. In my opinion, the top 3 species are as listed below:</p>
			 <ol id="l01">
  				<li>Red-Tailed Hawk</li>
 				<li>Cooper's Hawk</li>
				<li>Northern Goshawk</li>
			</ol>
